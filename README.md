"# COMP6231_Fall2023_Concordia" 
In this programming task, we create a basic iteration of an interactive remote terminal application using Python sockets. 
The application adheres to the client-server architectural model, wherein a central server actively listens for incoming connections from one or multiple clients.
A client transmits user commands to the server, which subsequently processes and responds by presenting the client with the current working directory (CWD) reflecting any recent modifications

To run the program -
Have both server.py and client.py running at the same time(Ensure server.py runs first)
Enter usercommand in the prompt requested by client.py

Refer to COMP6231_assignment_1_handout.pdf for usercommands and detailed explanation of project
